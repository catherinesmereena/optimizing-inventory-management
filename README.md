# optimizing-inventory-management
EOQ modeling and inventory cost optimization using R and Excel. Includes simulations, Solver validation, and decision support for order quantity strategy.
Optimizing Inventory Management: A Data-Driven Approach

This project focuses on optimizing inventory management for a manufacturing company using Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) modeling and simulation. Implemented in both **R** and **Excel**, it aims to minimize total inventory cost by determining the ideal order quantity and frequency.

---

##  Project Objectives
- Calculate the optimal **EOQ** and number of orders to minimize cost
- Model **total inventory cost** as the sum of ordering and holding costs
- Validate EOQ using Excel Solver
- Run simulations to assess the impact of demand variability

---

##  Techniques Used

### ï¿½ Part 1: EOQ & Total Cost Modeling
- Defined cost functions using order cost, holding rate, unit price, and demand
- Implemented cost curves and EOQ calculations in both R and Excel
- Verified optimal order quantity using **Excel Solver**

###  Part 2: Monte Carlo Simulation in R
- Simulated demand using **triangular distribution**
- Assessed expected EOQ, total cost, and number of orders across 3000 simulations
- Constructed histograms and confidence intervals (90%â€“95%)

---

##  Key Insights
- **Optimal EOQ:** ~604 units  
- **Total Cost at EOQ:** ~$10,016  
- Simulation showed **high stability** under fluctuating demand  
- What-if analysis helped visualize cost sensitivity under different cost scenarios
